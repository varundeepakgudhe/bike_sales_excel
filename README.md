<h1>Bike Sales Data Excel</h1>

This repository contains an Excel file named "Bike_sales_data_excel" that includes bike sales data and various data cleaning and analysis steps performed on the dataset. The purpose of this project is to provide insights into the bike sales data and facilitate data-driven decision-making.

<h3>Data Cleaning</h3>

To ensure data accuracy and reliability, the following data cleaning steps were performed on the dataset:

1. **Deleted duplicates:** Any duplicate entries in the dataset were removed to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.  
2. **Spelling mistake check:** Each column was carefully reviewed to identify and rectify any spelling mistakes. This was done by examining the unique values in each column using the filter menu.  
3. **Age brackets:** Age brackets were applied to categorize customers based on their age. This allows for better analysis and segmentation of the customer base.

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>

The cleaned dataset was analyzed using various Excel features and functions. The following analysis steps were performed:

1. **Average income per purchase:** Pivot tables were created to calculate the average income for each purchase. This analysis provides insights into the purchasing power and spending patterns of different customer segments.  
2. **Customer commute distance:** Pivot tables were used to analyze the customer commute distance. This information helps in understanding the preferences and requirements of customers based on their commuting habits.  
3. **Customer age bracket:** Another pivot table was created to analyze the distribution of customers across different age brackets. This analysis aids in identifying the target age groups and designing targeted marketing strategies.

<h3>Pivot Charts and Slicers</h3>

To visualize and interact with the data, pivot charts and slicers were implemented in the Excel file. The following features were included:

1. **Marital status slicer:** This slicer allows users to filter data based on customers' marital status. It provides a quick and convenient way to analyze the impact of marital status on bike sales.  
2. **Education slicer:** The education slicer enables data filtering based on customers' education level. This feature helps in understanding the educational background of customers and its influence on bike purchasing behavior.  
3. **Region slicer:** The region slicer enables users to filter data by region. This feature assists in analyzing bike sales performance across different geographic areas.
